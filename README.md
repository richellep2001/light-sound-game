## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
- stackoverflow.com
- youtube 
- w3schools.com


2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
   
  A challenege I encountered while creating this submission was completing the final two challenges. One of the reasons I could not 
  complete it (the last one) was the lack of time. With balancing full-time work and full-time school, it is hard to complete extra activities. So with that, 
  I did not have enough time when trying to research advise on how to approach it. My main challenge was with the 5 optional feature, which was 
  changing up the buttons. My idea was to implement a system when you press on a button, a comic strip action like "bang" or "boom" appears when the 
  button is active. However, all I was able to figure out was keeping the image there at all times, which wasnt the main goal. After countless looking 
  with the time I had, I was struggling to figure it out. I may have been overthinking the solution, but it was the most difficult for me. I even tried 
  adding the image class to the button:active sector but that woud only still have the image show at all times. Also tried adding " :active " to the 
  image class but still did not work. My last second try was asking a classmate in my team for my software engineering course. He helped me find the fix, which was 
  more simple then what I was thinking. Unfortunately with the last feature, I did not have enough time to implement it.
  

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

  One question I have about web development after completing this submission is it better working by yourself or working within a team. I usually complete
  majoritiy of my assignments/projects by myself, which is a normal occurence for me. However, when I get stuck on something, and I cannot find help within
  my personal resources, I tend to stay at a pothole which can probably be fixed with the help of a teammate. But there can alo be cons to that. Another 
  question I have is how long does it take (on average) to complete a project. Lastly, how often should I be practicing code in this field, and if should I mainly 
  stick to the main three languages (html, javascript,css) or more. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

  If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would try to implement a two player system. This will add a way for two people to have a competition over 
  this game. I would have both players have different patterns, and whoever messes up their level first gets a strike. The website will keep count of the strikes and 
  whoever hits 3 first loses. Another feature I would attempt to do is have the game change locations of the buttons. This would make the challenge of the player not being 
  able to rely solely on muscle memory. For this feature, however, I would make it a seperate mode, so players can go back to the original at any time.
